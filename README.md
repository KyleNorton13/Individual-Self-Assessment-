# Individual-Self-Assessment-

## Self Assessment

My role for the group project was to develop the machine learning model for our dataset. For the model I decided to go with a logistic regression oversampling method for 3 of the datasets and for the full dataset I used the balanced random forest classifer method. I test numerous other models and these were the ones that produced the best outcome. As a team we frequently met to discuss the steps that were taking and how we could potentially make it more efficient. The greatest challenge for myself was dtermining the model that would produce the best result as well as getting the data set up and fromatted in the best possible manner. I put in a lot of time studying and testing over the last month in order to ensure that I would produce a desired result for my group and by the end of it I am very satisifed with the work that I was able to display for this project. 

## Team Assesment

Our team worked great together through every step of this project. We met multiple times a week, we would make modifications to our schedules just so we could provide support to our team memebers. Everyone took on their role and made the most of it. While we all had out individual roles, we never hesitated to help in any spot that was needed which really drove the success of our team performance. 

## Summary of Project

Our project was designed to predict if an individual was diabetic based on numerous health indicators, socioeconomic factors and lifestyle factors. The goal was to find which factors/indicators correlated strongest with the predicted outcome. To do this we used a logistical regression machine learning model for our data analysis, tableau for our visualtion and aws for our database.
